Ransomware attacks are a growing threat, causing data loss and financial burden. This project tackles this challenge by developing a machine learning-powered expert system.

Here's how it works:

1. Analyzes ransomware samples: The system performs a deep analysis of the ransomware binary.
2. Classification: It accurately classifies the ransomware into existing families.
3. Solution Recommendation: Based on the classification, the system searches online resources and identifies potential decryption tools or mitigation strategies.
